# Contributing Guideline

Welcome to contributing! We are happy to accept your contributions, 
and here is a few ways you can contribute:

### Creating issues
You are welcome to create new issues to the project if you feel there is a need for it! 
There is a template for issues, that you should follow. GitHub should generate it automatically, but if it doesn't, here it is:
```markdown
### Versions of libraries used (if applicable):
- GLerminal: 

### Expected Behaviour

### Actual Behaviour

### Steps to reproduce this behaviour
```

### Creating pull requests
You are also welcome to create pull requests, though if you do, do make sure there is an issue for that pull request first!
There is a template for pull requests too. GitHub should generate it too automatically, but if it doesn't, here it is:
```markdown
Fixes # .

### Changes proposed in this pull request

```


### Other Contributions
Sometimes you might want to contribute otherwise than issues or pull requests, such as suggestions, requests or other questions,
in these cases you might want to check out [GLerminal's discord](https://discord.gg/Wg6D2Rk) where you can post 
suggestions and requests in the #development channel, or simply contact [Teascade at Mastodon](https://social.targaryen.house/@Teascade)
