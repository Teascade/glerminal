# Code of Conduct

The code of conduct applies in any official GLerminal outlets and issues such as:
- GitHub Issues and Pull-Requests (and such Git interactions)
- Discord server interactions
- Social media interactions (eg. mastodon)

The code of conduct for GLerminal is quite simple:
- Be welcoming and nice
- No spamming
- No offensive language
- You will be excluded from interaction if you insult, demean or harrass anyone. 
Any sort of harrassment is absolutely forbidden and 
no matter who you are or however are you participating in the community, 
it is important you do not feel threatened.

Other rules may be added later on if they become necessary.  
Currently you can report violations of the code of conduct via  
- [teascade@gmail.com](mailto:teascade@gmail.com), 
- [GLerminal's discord channel](https://discord.gg/Wg6D2Rk), 
- or just via [mastodon](https://social.targaryen.house/@teascade)

Violations of the code may result in a kick/ban from the discord server 
and/or the inability to participate in the project.
